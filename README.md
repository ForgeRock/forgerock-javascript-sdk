The ForgeRock JavaScript SDK enables you to quickly integrate the [ForgeRock Identity Platform](https://www.forgerock
.com/digital-identity-and-access-management-platform) into your client-side JavaScript apps.

Use the SDKs to leverage _[Intelligent Authentication](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-authentication)_ in [ForgeRock's Access Management (AM)](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management) product, to easily step through each stage of an authentication tree by using callbacks.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- REQUIREMENTS - Supported AM versions, API versions, any other requirements. -->

## Requirements

* ForgeRock Identity Platform
    * Access Management (AM) 6.5.2+

* Browsers:
    * Chrome 42
    * Firefox 39
    * Safari 10.1
    * Edge 15

> **Tip**: Older browsers can be supported by using polyfills.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

```
npm install @forgerock/javascript-sdk
```

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- QUICK START - Get one of the included samples up and running in as few steps as possible. -->

## Getting Started

To try out the ForgeRock JavaScript SDK, perform these steps:

1. Setup CORS support in an Access Management (AM) instance.

   See [Enabling CORS Support](https://sdks.forgerock.com/js/01_prepare-am/#enabling-cors-support) in the Documentation.
2. Create an authentication tree in AM.

   See [Creating a User Authentication Tree](https://sdks.forgerock.com/js/01_prepare-am/#creating-a-user
 -authentication-tree) in the Documentation.
4. Clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk.git
    ```

5. Open `samples/js/config.js` and edit the values to match your AM instance.
6. Serve the `samples` directory by using a simple HTTP server, for example:
   `npx http-server samples -c1 -p 3000`
7. In a [supported web browser](#requirements), navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index.html`, and then click
 **Custom UI**.

   > **Note**:
   >
   > Using `localhost` is for testing and evaluation purposes **only**.
   >
   > Use a fully-qualified domain name, and the HTTPS protocol in production environments.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- SAMPLES - List the samples we include with the SDKs, where they are, briefly what they show. -->

## Samples

ForgeRock provides these samples to help demonstrate SDK functionality:

- **Custom UI - `/samples/custom-ui`**

    In most real-world scenarios, you will want to have full control over the UI. In these cases, you can use `FRAuth`
    to obtain typed callback instances from authentication trees and render the UI in whatever way makes sense for your application.

    In this example, a simple React app iteratively calls `FRAuth.next()` until either an error occurs, or the sample obtains a session token.

    The custom React component `<UsernamePassword />` is defined to handle an authentication step named "_UsernamePassword_".
