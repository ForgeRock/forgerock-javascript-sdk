The ForgeRock JavaScript SDK enables you to quickly integrate the [ForgeRock Identity Platform](https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity-and-access-management-platform) into your client-side JavaScript apps.

Use the SDKs to leverage _[Intelligent Authentication](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-authentication)_ in [ForgeRock's Access Management (AM)](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management) product, to easily step through each stage of an authentication tree by using callbacks.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- REQUIREMENTS - Supported AM versions, API versions, any other requirements. -->

## Requirements

* ForgeRock Identity Platform
    * Access Management (AM) 6.5.2+

* Browsers:
    * Chrome 87
    * Firefox 84
    * Safari 14
    * Edge 87 (Chromium)
    * Edge 44 (Legacy): requires one polyfill for TextEncoder, [`fast-text-encoding` is recommended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-text-encoding)

> **Tip**: Older browsers (like IE11) may require multiple [polyfills, which can be found in our documentation](https://sdks.forgerock.com/javascript/polyfills/).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

```
npm install @forgerock/javascript-sdk
```

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- QUICK START - Get one of the included samples up and running in as few steps as possible. -->

## Getting Started

To try out the ForgeRock JavaScript SDK, perform these steps:

1. Setup CORS support in an Access Management (AM) instance.

   See [Enabling CORS Support](https://sdks.forgerock.com/js/01_prepare-am/#enabling-cors-support) in the Documentation.

2. Create an authentication tree in AM.

   See [Creating a User Authentication Tree](https://sdks.forgerock.com/js/01_prepare-am/#creating-a-user-authentication-tree) in the Documentation.

3. Clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk.git
    ```

4. In the root folder of the repo, use NPM to install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

5. Build the ForgeRock JavaScript SDK:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

6. Open `samples/custom-ui/index.html` and edit the configuration values to match your AM instance.

7. This SDK requires HTTPS (secure protocol) which means security (SSL/TLS) certificates are necessary. For local testing and development, it's common to generate your own self-signed certificates. You're free to use any method to do this, but if you need assistance in generating your own certs, the following can be helpful:

    - Using [this utility (`mkcert`) can help simplify the process of creating trusted certs](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
    - After following `mkcert`'s installation guide and simple example of creating certs, you should have two files: `example.com+5.pem` & `example.com+5-key.pem`

        (Ensure these two files are in the root of this project)

    > **Warning: Self-signed certificates or certificates not from an industry-recognized, certificate authority (CA) should never be used in production.**

8. Serve the `samples` directory by using a simple HTTP server.

   - If you used the `mkcert` utility from above, followed their tutorial, and the files are in the root of this project, simply run `npm run start:samples`
   - Or, if you generated certs using a different method, you will need to run the below with your certificate and key file names you created:

       ```
       http-server samples -c1 -p 8443 --ssl --cert <your_certificate> --key <your_private_key>
       ```

9. Edit your `/etc/hosts` file to point your localhost (e.g. `127.0.0.1`) to `sdkapp.example.com`

10. In a [supported web browser](#requirements), navigate to `https://sdkapp.example.com:8443`, and then click
 **Custom UI**.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- SAMPLES - List the samples we include with the SDKs, where they are, briefly what they show. -->

## Samples

ForgeRock provides these samples to help demonstrate SDK functionality:

- **Custom UI - `/samples/custom-ui`**

    In most real-world scenarios, you will want to have full control over the UI. In these cases, you can use `FRAuth`
    to obtain typed callback instances from authentication trees and render the UI in whatever way makes sense for your application.

    In this example, a simple React app iteratively calls `FRAuth.next()` until either an error occurs, or the sample obtains a session token.

    The custom React component `<UsernamePassword />` is defined to handle an authentication step named "_UsernamePassword_".
