## [3.0.0] - 2021-6-24

### Added

- "Native" Social Login callbacks for both the original AM nodes in 6.5 and the new IDM nodes in 7.0
- SDK Social Login feature officially supports Apple, Facebook and Google
- New `FRAuth` methods for handing redirection to provider and resuming an authentication journey
  - `FRAuth.redirect` for redirecting to an Identity Provider for authentication
  - `FRAuth.resume` supports both return from an IdP and returning from Email Suspend node
- New `FRAuth.start` method that aliases `FRAuth.next` to align native mobile SDKs
- E2E test pages will now follow your OS's dark mode setting

### Fixed

- Arbitrary query parameters are now passed along through to the `/authorize` endpoint supporting the use of ACR values for tree specificity
- Fixed build issue when using Windows PowerShell
- WebAuthn error handling is now standardized according to the WebAuthn spec
- When WebAuthn encounters an error, the SDK now formats the error appropriately for AM and sets it into the hiddenValueCallback; this allows the developer to just send it to AM "as is" or handle it specially when catching the thrown error
- Changed the default behavior in case of unidentified storage, to be the localStorage option
- Increased timeout (20 to 60 seconds) for E2E tests to avoid pure timeout failures

### Breaking

- WebAuthn's thrown error message text has been changed to align with spec, so check all conditionals comparing error message strings
- Renamed `getAuthorizeUrl` method to `getAuthCodeByIframe`
- Removed the single parameter from `createVerifier` function
- Removal of `nonce` function

## [2.2.0] - 2020-12-18

### Added

- Centralized login support has been added
- OAuth authorize endpoint now supports both iframe and fetch through the new `support` property in the config
- Support for TypeScript 4.0

### Fixed

- `step.getStage()` is no longer used in sample app; `getStage(step)` is now used for better compatibility with AM 6.5
- `FRUser.logout` now uses a try-catch around each endpoint call, rather than a single try-catch, ensuring an error in one doesn't interrupt other endpoints being called
- Paths for sample app now point to correct favicon image
- Improved automation testing
- Compatibility with AM 6.5.3 WebAuthn nodes
- Step detection with `getWebAuthnStepType` and "usernameless" configuration
- `getTokens` method with `forceRenew` now revokes existing tokens, if present, before requesting new ones

## [2.1.0] - 2020-08-25

### Added

- Support for "usernameless" login (storing username on WebAuthn capable tech)
- Support for the recovery code display node and the parsing of the codes from the TextOutputCallback
- Support for user verification property for WebAuthn
- Updated support for new IDM nodes for registration and self-service: BooleanAttributeInputCallback and NumberAttributeInputCallback support

- Added SessionManager.logout() call back to FRUser.logout()

### Fixed

- Conditionally set user verification, relying party and allow credentials to WebAuthn key options
- Added exclude credentials to script parsing for WebAuthn key options
- Ensure display name and username are correctly parsed and added to WebAuthn key options
- Add authenticator attachment to WebAuthn and other WebAuthn fixes for custom configuration
- Increased entropy for cryptographic functions related to PKCE for both state and verifier
- Improved instructions for cert creation for sample app

### Deprecated

- Name change for `getAuthorizeUrl`: method's name will change to better reflect its behavior in v3
- Removal of `nonce`: this utility is no longer used in the SDK, and therefore will be removed in v3
